# DES Calculator

## Overview

This project is a Data Encryption Standard (DES) calculator developed for the EECE455 course (Cryptography and Network Security) at the American University of Beirut (AUB). The purpose of this website is to serve as an educational tool for DES, providing a user-friendly interface for encryption and decryption operations.

## Features

- **Input Box:**
  - Allows users to enter parameters such as encryption or decryption option, key, and plaintext or ciphertext.
  - Calculation Button: Inside the input box, performs the DES calculation based on the provided input.

- **Output Box:**
  - Displays the result of the calculation, showing "Result Ciphertext = \<result\>" or "Result Plaintext = \<result\>" depending on the chosen option.
  - Show Explanation Button: Inside the output box, reveals a table detailing the steps of the DES algorithm, including initial permutation, 16 rounds, and inverse permutation.

- **Show History Button:**
  - Displays a menu with previous calculation results. Users can delete individual results or refresh the entire history.

- **DES Explained Button:**
  - Provides access to 19 slides explaining DES concepts, sourced from the course material.

- **DES Lectures Button:**
  - Directs users to Neso Academy DES YouTube channel for additional lectures on DES.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The website is designed to ensure user-friendliness, and it is responsive to screens ranging from 280px width (smallest phone) to above 1200px (large screens), encompassing both portrait and landscape modes on iOS and Android devices. Additionally, it fits various height dimensions (also from 28px till above 1200px), providing an optimal viewing experience across a diverse range of devices. The layout dynamically adjusts to deliver a consistent and visually appealing presentation, enhancing accessibility for all users.

## Usage

1. Enter the required parameters in the input box.
2. Click the "Calculate" button inside the input box to perform the DES operation.
3. Use the "Show Explanation" button inside the output box to view the detailed steps of the calculation.
4. Explore the "Show History" menu to review and manage previous calculation results.
5. Access educational slides with the "DES Explained" button.
6. Visit the linked YouTube channel for DES lectures via the "DES Lectures" button.

**Note:** Ensure that the input is a 16-character hexadecimal string. Incorrect inputs will trigger an alert.
